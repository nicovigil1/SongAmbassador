# SongAmbassador


## About the Project

SongAmbassador is the FrontEnd to a full-stack application. It calls an API built in JavaScript using the React library used for building the User interface.
The full app will allow users to search for artists/songs and favorite them into selected playlist.

## Local Setup

You'll need to setup an API key with Musixmatch:
